## POC for testing react-native-unistyles

Change the main.js import path to see different approaches between
styling libraries:

- Stylesheet from react-native
- Styled components from styled-components
- Stylesheet from react-native-unistyles
- Unistyled components from react-native-unistyles

## Unistyled

Unistyled is an attempt to generate a function that provides similar API
to styled-components, but using react-native unistyles under the hood.
